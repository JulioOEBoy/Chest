## 🌍 Mundo 2 – Conditional Structures and Loops
This world introduces:
- Deeper use of conditionals
- Loop structures (`while`, `for`)
- Nesting conditions and loops
- Building small interactive programs

📌 *Example exercises: grading systems, interactive menus, guessing games, custom loops.*

## 🌍 Mundo 3 – Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries & Data Handling
Here, you dive into:
- Collections like tuples, lists, and dictionaries
- Looping through data structures
- Sorting, filtering, and counting elements
- Basic algorithms with user input

📌 *Example exercises: finding maximum and minimum values, identifying even numbers, working with data positions.*
